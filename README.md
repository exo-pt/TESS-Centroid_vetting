# TESS centroid_vetting

Attempt to make a centroid vetting function graphically similar to the one used in the DV reports of TCE's produced by the TESS Science Processing Pipeline.<br/>
This centroid presentation allows to identify the source of the dips in a lightcurve, and discard eventual false positives, but was limited to targets with Threshold Crossing Events (TCE).

## Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- astropy
- astroquery
- scipy
- lightkurve
- ipywidgets - only needed if interact=True in show_transit_margins()

## Usage
See the notebooks in Examples directory for usage.
